   1053375|57a11068||Once part of Redania, Novigrad now has the status of a free city. It is the world's largest city and, without a doubt, the richest as well. Cradle of the cult of the Eternal Fire, it is now home to the church of the same name. It is ruled officially by the head of the church, referred to as the hierarch, though its underworld crime bosses also have a great deal of say in matters.
   1053347|f658b69b||Once upon a time Oxenfurt was a renowned university center, a capital of learning and liberty. The outbreak of war brought Redanian troops to the city, King Radovid at their head. The university dorrs were shut and locked, the students were driven out, and the entire town began to feel like an extension of the infamous prison located within its walls.

If anyone previously believed the ongoing war did not concern the free city, not a single resident now doubts the further course of the conflict will be determined within its walls. Our agents have confirmed earlier reports contending that King Radovid has important plans for Novigrad, and lately we have observed an increase in his agents' activity as well as the spread of his propaganda. His prime objective seems to be seizure of the wealth held by the Church of the Eternal Fire. Yet though Hierarch Hemmelfart officially rules the city, true power is in the hands of local crime lords. I recommend the emperor's agents focus further activity in that direction.<br><br>Henry var Attre<br><br>by decree of His Imperial Majesty<br><br>Ambassador of the Empire of Nilfgaard in the Free City of Novigrad

   1049221|00000000||Those who stray off the beaten tracks in the bogs of Velen rarely live to amend their error. Even the Nilfgaardian soldiers stationed at the Army Group 'Center' camp would at times disappear in the marshes without a trace. After yet another patrol failed to return, the quartermaster of the camp posted a call for some brave soul to search them out and bring them back, or, barring that, at least determine their fate.<br>
   1050852|00000000||When Geralt entered the Novigrad bathhouse, he happened to walk in on a meeting of the heads of the city's criminal underworld. Becoming an unwitting participant in their conversation, he learned of the conflict between the triumvirate made up of the King of Beggars, Sigi Reuven and Carlo "Cleaver" Varese on the one hand, and Whoreson Junior and the unknown powers backing him on the other. Cleaver in particular wanted Whoreson gone and offered Geralt help in finding and gettin to the bastard, which suited Geralt's interests. They say hands aplenty make for light work, and Geralt had every reason to believe this applied to gang warfare as much as it did to cleaning a barn, so he graciously accepted the gangster's offer.<br>

Geralt was thus not shocked to meet the woman who the children in the Velen swamps called Gran, though she seemed to have suffered manifold unspecified ills.<br><br>Whatever her woes, it was clear she cared for the war orphans in her charge with love and devotion.<br>
   1062446|00000000||When Geralt saw the marks on the woman’s hands, he quickly realized she must be the Bloody Baron’s wife, though changed beyond all recognition by the hardship she had suffered.<br>
   1062444|00000000||Gran bore strange marks on her hands that burned with living fire. In time they proved to be signs of her indentured servitude to the Crones. How exactly the old woman had come to be in their power, however, remained unknown.<br>

One suspects no unauthorized thievery, banditry or hucksterism of any sort takes place here. Perhaps this is a testament to the City Council’s effective reinvigoration of the Temple Guard, but it is my opinion that the true cause lies in the rise of organized crime groups.

Taking down the bodies of rebels executed by hanging is considered aid to the rebellion. By imperial decree, bandits thus punished are to serve as a warning to other rabble-rousers, and so their corpses are to hang at the roadside until they drop of their own accord to fertilize the once Temerian, now Nilfgaardian soil for the glory of the emperor.

   1061789|99d66d40||<i>Childhood and Early Manhood</i><br><br>Though the Nilfgaardian throne was his by right of birth, it would be many long years before Emhyr var Emreis sat upon it. When he was but thirteen, an uprising engulfed the empire’s capital. A usurper seized power, overthrowing Emhyr’s father, Fergus var Emreis, who then refused to grant legitimacy to the coup. The usurper then decided he would break Fergus by having mages torture his son and heir, Emhyr. He failed in his plan, was forced to kill Fergus, and Emhyr escaped, presumably to a land beyond the empire's borders.<br><br>No reliable accounts of the emperor's actions in exile exist. Some claim he fell into the company of a knight errant, serving as his squire. This seems plausible enough, though the tales about the eccentric knight's proclivity to charge at windmills must surely be storytellers' exaggerations. A few unreliable reports claim a connection between Emhyr and the fabled Urcheon of Erlenwald who saved the life of King Roegner of Cintra. This seems far less likely, for it is public record that when the witcher Geralt of Rivia lifted the Urcheon's curse, he was revealed to be a duke named Duny, who later wed Roegner's daughter, Pavetta, and perished at her side when their ship went down at sea.<br><br>What is known for certain is that around the time of this great tragedy for the kingdom of Cintra, Emhyr reappeared in the empire and led a revolt to overthrow the usurper and restore his own birthright. Soon after he led the empire's armies in their successful conquest of Cintra, setting a tone of determined military expansion that would endure through the rest of his reign.
   1061810|0b1524e1||The Second War against Nilfgaard
   1061808|7fef2684||War with Nilfgaard first broke out in 1263 - its immediate cause a clear act of aggression by Nilfgaard against Cintra. The Imperial Army crossed the Amell Mountains and attacked Cintra's southern border posts near the forest known as Erlenwald. There are unverified claims of Emhyr var Emreis having a special attachment for this place - their import, however, remains unknown. What is certain is that he long ago staked an unfounded claim to control over all Cintra.<br><br>The decisive battle of the conflict took place in the Marnadal Valley. There Nilfgaard surrounded and decimated Cintra’s forces led by the royal couple. King Eist Tuirseach fell in the battle. The survivors, led by Queen Calanthe, sought shelter in the capital, yet none was to be found there. The city was overrun, its population massacred, and Queen Calanthe preferred to take her own life rather than surrender to the invaders.<br><br>The theater of war then shifted to Upper Sodden, where acts of terror and barbarous cruelty were perpetrated. Historical consensus holds that the Imperial Army's bestial acts here propelled the North to victory during the so-called Second Battle of Sodden. The atrocities had left the northern forces with only two options: to win the war, or to die with their families. Desperate determination thus drove them to defeat the seemingly invincible Nilfgaardians. The next year, in 1264, an armistice was signed which ceded control of Cintra to the empire, making it the northernmost province of Nilfgaard in all but name.
   1061814|8de4bdcb||Unlike in the First War against Nilfgaard, there was no clear aggressor at the start of the second conflict. In early 1267 the kings of the North met at Hagge to prepare a plan for Cintra's reconquest. Foreseeing their intentions, Emperor var Emreis amassed a large expeditionary force on the Temerian border. He then masterminded a series of events that left the North ripe for invasion - a mages' revolt erupted on Thanedd Island, and Redania descended into chaos after King Vizimir was assassinated. All Emhyr needed now was a pretext, which he got when supposedly Aedirnian soldiers attacked the Nilfgaardian frontier fortress known as Glevitzingen. Armed with this excuse, Nilfgaardian forces marched north and thus began the second war.<br><br>During the war's first phase, the imperial offensive quickly swept across the North. The empire's army started by occupying southern Lyria. Rivia was next to fall, after a short siege. Then came the Battle of Aldersberg, followed by Menno Coehoorn's march into Vengerberg. King Henselt of Kaedwen seized this opportunity to dismember his neighbor and promptly signed a treaty with Nilfgaard partitioning Aedirn between them. Opportunistic elves also joined the empire's cause and for their trouble gained an independent realm in Dol Blathanna. King Foltest was the next rat to scurry from the sinking ship, signing a truce with Nilfgaard and grabbing for himself a portion of western Aedirn. Abandoned by his allies and left with the rump of his kingdom, Demavend, ruler of Aedirn, fled to seek shelter in Redania.<br><br>The war's first stage ended and its second stage began when Nilfgaard broke its truce with Temeria after a mere fortnight and two days. Its forces immediately entered Brugge and Sodden, and soon both lands were awash in blood. In short order Emhyr occupied all of southern Temeria and shattered Foltest’s troops at Maribor. The shrewd emperor then retreated for the winter to Sodden, where he prepared for a renewed offensive come spring.<br><br>No war in history saw such fierce battles as were waged during the great Temerian offensive undertaken over those fair spring days. The forces of the North, united at last, proved a worthy opponent and slowed the Nilfgaardian advance. This provided Emhyr's internal enemies with an opening to set in motion a plot designed to depose him. Weakened by the infighting (known as the Conspiracy of Nobles), the myth of its invincibility shattered, Nilfgaard then saw its mightiest army routed by northern forces near Brenna. The tide of war had clearly turned.<br><br>Thus began the war's fourth and final phase. The North embarked on a counter-offensive, forcing the Imperial Army into a slow and bloody retreat. It was only a matter of time before armistice talks began, temporary truce lines were drawn, and the war drew to a close. Delegates from all parties to the conflict convened in Cintra to draft a peace treaty and establish a new world order. On the 2nd of April, 1268, the Peace of Cintra was signed, bringing to an end the Second War against Nilfgaard.
   1061823|862df541||Temeria… a land where milk and honey once flowed. In what did she wrong the gods that they should treat her so cruelly? The Pearl of the North to some, she proved a galloping range for Nilfgaardian cavalry to others. As a country it had survived two previous wars against the empire. It was here that the wars' bloodiest battles were fought. It was in Temeria where their most bestial deeds were wrought. It was Temerian civilians who bore the full brunt of these wars' horrors.<br><br>And bear them we did, bravely and steadfastly, until the demise of our great protector - King Foltest. Then providence turned its fickle face from Temeria. Murdered most treacherously, Foltest failed to leave Temeria a worthy successor.<br><br>And so all manner of cur soon fell upon her, tearing her apart like so much carrion. She had no more allies, then. None remembered that we had once been the armor protecting the North from the designs of the mad Dancer, he who had the gravestones of his foes pounded into a ballroom floor.<br><br>A free and independent Temeria is no more. A dark-faced sun looms over her every rampart. Yet we Temerians live on. And always will. As long as folk believe, the usurper who took our beloved capital, Vizima, to treat as his property will forever peer over his shoulder in fear. For in the shadows lurks not one dagger, but the power of a nation of daggers, waiting to deal justice’s blow.

   1061792|8a55e082||Responsibility for the outbreak of the first war (1263-1264) lies wholly with the Temerian Special Forces. Intercepted documents clearly show that Temeria intended to annex Cintra and moved in this direction, dealing a brazen blow to the balance of power that the Empire could not abide. Only by moving its forces into Cintra and establishing order there could the Empire preempt the Temerians’ destructive actions and safeguard peace. Sadly, the North, stubborn and short-sighted as ever, chose armed conflict over reasonable compromise.<br><br>During this conflict the forces of the Northern Realms perpetrated unpardonable atrocities, for which reprisals came first with the Battle of the Marnadal Valley and then with the Cintrian Incident. Our Imperial Majesty, Emhyr var Emreis, expressed his sympathies in a letter to the Cintrian court, adding that he hoped such horrors would never need to be repeated.<br><br>Once Cintra was taken, Nilfgaard considered the situation in the North stabilized, yet the Northern Realms fought on, bringing the situation to a head with the clash near Sodden. Nordling propaganda depicts this battle as the turning point of the war. In truth it had no political significance whatever. Shortly afterwards an armistice was signed, rendering Cintra a vassal of the Empire of Nilfgaard for all eternity.

   1061797|d055438d||The Empire and the North crossed swords again in 1267 to 1268. Following an eruption of mage treachery on Thanedd Island, Nilfgaard could not sit idly by while the North let magic sow destruction freely. The Imperial Army took Lyria at lightning speed, meeting with little resistance. After short sieges, our forces marched into Rivia and Vengerberg, greeted each time by jubilant crowds thirsty for peace and civilization. We then moved against Aedirn.<br><br>(…) King Demavend’s attempt to stop the Golden Sun’s triumphant march failed, and his forces were pushed back to the Pontar Valley and Dol Blathanna.<br><br>(…) Queen Meve began to format guerilla bands made up of bandits and outlaws, of which the North has never been short.<br><br>(…) In a display of typical Nordling treachery, King Henselt signed a truce with the Empire behind his allies’ backs, resulting in Aedirn being promptly partitioned.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty, in an act of supreme benevolence, created an elven state in Dol Blathanna, thus forging a bulwark of tolerance against the abhorrent racist laws of the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) King Foltest of Temeria signed a truce with the Empire. Yet this Nordling’s word proved to have as much value as the snow melting in the fields that spring. The truce held a mere sixteen days before it was violated. Foltest’s stupidity led to the Slaughter of Brugge, and then to a number of bloody battles in the Yaruga Valley. Faced with senseless and uncontrolled violence, the Imperial Army's leadership took it upon itself to tamp the bloodshed and ordered a retreat to Sodden.<br><br>Sadly, Foltest’s greed meant that hostilities resumed with the coming of spring. They culminated with the Battle of Brenna, where our heroic regiments faced a combined Temerian-Redanian force. To this day the North considers said battle a turning point in the war. There is no point debating this conviction. Far more important is the fact that this battle saw two strategies confronted: an honorable one, presented by the Imperial Army’s leadership, and one of trickery and subterfuge, conducted by the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty realized the direction the conflict had taken. The Northern armies employed scorched-earth tactics, caring not at all for the pain they inflicted on civilian populations. Disgusted and unwilling to take part in this type of war, Nilfgaard withdrew its armies south. The Nordlings mistakenly saw this as an admission of defeat.<br><br>(…) Through the Emperor’s mediation, an armistice was drawn up and eventually signed in Cintra, putting an end to the Second Northern War.
   1061803|eda9be4c||Emhyr var Emreis rules to expand. He has trained his strategic brilliance on a singular vision - to conquer the world, though he rightly calls this not conquest, but salvation. Yes. The emperor of Nilfgaard sets the world alight with the torch of civilization.<br><br>Trampling the still-warm corpses of his father's usurpers, the emperor seized the throne and began to assimilate the Northern Realms, one after the other. Terror engulfed the North. Only the Battle of Brenna slowed the Imperial Army's march toward victory. A temporary peace then took hold, though none believed this mirage would last. Emhyr’s aim, to make the entire North a vassal of Nilfgaard, remained unchanged. Emhyr used peace as a cover to intensify his political efforts. Now all can see their results - chaos and disorder devour the Nordlings’ states. Ridden with internal bickering and backstabbing, they near collapse. Only a strong ruler can grapple this dysfunction into function. Only a wise ruler can give vision to their blindness. Only Emhyr var Emreis can save the North. So our armies have again crossed the Yaruga - for the third and final time…
   1061805|73f86c88||The First War against Nilfgaard
   1061842|00000000||As it turned out, Radovid's plan was for Whoreson to start a gang war in Novigrad. In the resulting chaos, Radovid would take control of the city with ease.<br>
   1061841|00000000||Whoreson's audacity had a very specific cause - King Radovid, who had commissioned the gangster's actions.<br>
   1061840|00000000||Cyprian also took after his father in terms of ambition. He broke the unwritten armistice between Novigrad's various criminal groups and tried to murder the other three leading underworld bosses.<br>
   1061850|00000000||This spy's life story would make for a positively enthralling adventure tale. A victim of Philippa Eilhart's intrigues, he had been forced to flee Redania at breakneck speed - or have his own neck broken by assassins. For a certain time he sought refuge in far-off lands, but in the end he decided to return to the Free City of Novigrad.<br>
   1061849|00000000||Though he did not show it, in his own way Dijkstra respected Geralt - even though the very thought of their last meeting brought a pained grimace to his face. The two had found themselves standing in each other's way during the coup on Thanedd Island. The stalemate was quickly broken when Geralt summarily broke Dijkstra's leg.<br>
   1061848|00000000||The individual masquerading as Sigi Reuven was in fact none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, the former head of Redanian intelligence and a man Geralt and I had had many dealings with in the past.<br><br>He had fallen out of King Radovid's favor and nothing had been heard of him for many years. Now it seemed he had finally decided to emerge from the shadows, but instead of returning to high political wrangling he dove deep into the criminal underground - and quickly surfaced as one of its leading figures.<br>
   1061839|00000000||Cyprian Wiley the younger was one of Novigrad's most dangerous criminals. He had inherited his father's casinos, fighting ring and brothels – as well as the old man's sadistic tendencies, ruthlessness and lack of scruples.<br><br>These traits had made the moniker "Whoreson" something of a family heirloom for his powerful criminal clan.<br>
   1061875|3123eb57||(…) Which brings us to the epithet of the current ruler of Redania - “the Stern.” Allow me to diagnose the causes and consequences of this appellation.<br><br>Firstly, the seeds of Radovid’s Sternness were surely planted in his childhood. When Radovid was born to King Vizimir and Queen Hedwig in 1255, his care was immediately entrusted to Philippa Eilhart, the court sorceress. While none dared question if she was fit for the role of tutor, few now envisage her as having been a warm caregiver to a young child - and whatever harsh lessons she gave Radovid clearly left a lasting mark.<br><br>The next step on Radovid’s path to becoming the Stern? The death of his father when Radovid was but 13 years of age. Though rumor has it father and son barely knew one another, the mere fact of being thrust into one’s inheritance at such an early age and in such murky circumstances must have had a hardening effect.<br><br>Finally, the regency finished schooling Radovid towards becoming the Stern. Led by Sigismund Dijkstra of Tretogor, the Regency Council imparted upon Radovid a style of politics seeped in Dijkstra's aggressive, no-holds-barred, reason-of-state-first principles.<br><br>Such are the causes of Radovid’s temperament - now on to the consequences. Most manifestations of his fierce manner are well known, however, a few illustrative examples might prove useful here. They include his summoning of the Order of the Flaming Rose to be his armed enforcers, his later support for the witch hunters in their zealous cause, and finally, there is the massacre at Loc Muinne…<br><br>Yet it is in the fight against Nilfgaard that Radovid has proven himself truly the Stern. While the forces of other realms disintegrated in the face of the empire’s onslaught, he has strengthened his own realm and taken command of the joint armies of the North. Whatever their opinion of him before, all clear-eyed observers now agree: Radovid V, known also as Radovid the Stern, is the North’s last bulwark against Emhyr’s expanding power.
   1061882|a382fb62||(...) and so the emperor’s brutes crossed the Yaruga’s waters. Yet this splashing was but a foretaste of the ocean of Temerian blood they would yet spill. Black has swarmed over our sweet Temerian soil, like ants swarming a drop of honey fallen in their path. Emhyr’s cutthroats adore their master and long to emulate his desecrations. The Nilfgaardian onslaught will spare no one. Under its sun-adorned banners hide dark hordes, cackling with anticipation, gleefully practicing how they will prance on the graves of our elders, women and children alike…<br><br>Good folk of the North! The time has come to unite! Forget our past feuds and quarrels! There is but one foe, one despicable to us all! Let us spare no blood, for each drop spilled might save the life of a brothers.<br><br>Yet is there any man who will not yield before their frightful charge, before that mass clad in plate black as pitch and stinking of the blood of the raped and murdered…?<br><br>I tell you there is, brothers and sisters. There is one man whom the loathsome foe frightens not one bit. A man who, armed with wisdom, courage and cunning, can give fight to the southern plague. That man's name is Radovid V. The Stern, they call him, and in this we are blessed, for only such a man can turn back the deluge of iron and steel, send it rushing back whence it came.<br><br>Mothers, weep not for your sons! Death for a noble cause is an honor every man should embrace. Let your menfolk gather round the banners of Redania's ruler, for he is no longer just Redania's - he is the proud commander of the united forces of the Northern Realms!
   1061884|00000000||Not for the first time Geralt showed what a babe in the wilderness he was in matters involving the fairer sex. For while I can say from experience that there are indeed women who will willingly share a man with their best friend, when trying that with women to whom one has declared true and undying love, things tend to turn out differently.<br><br>Toying with Triss' feelings ended in humiliation for Geralt - a fate which, I must admit, he thoroughly deserved.<br>
   1061871|dd61ca57||Redania is a kingdom belonging to the so-called League of Northern States. It is located between the Buina and Pontar rivers, bordered by Temeria to the south and Kovir and Caingorn to the north. To its east lies Kaedwen, and to its southeast - Aedirn. Its capital is Tretogor, yet the land's most famous cities are Oxenfurt, home to the enclave of culture and learning that is the Oxenfurt Academy, and Novigrad, which, while a free city, stands on Redanian soil.<br><br>The cult of the nobility runs strong in Redania. That social stratum possesses more privileges here than in any nearby realm. Great differences in wealth exist among the gentry, but Redanian law cares for birth not property, making a well-born beggar the legal equal of the richest magnate. Those of high birth and great wealth draw the latter primarily from the grain trade and pedigreed horse husbandry. This last the Redanians excel at, outdoing all other nations - Redanian steeds are unsurpassed. The Redanian cavalry is thus among the best formations of its kind in the world, and with the country's nobility filling its ranks it is the heart of the Redanian armed forces. As a consequence of the nobility's privileged position, the peasantry is treated worse here than in neighboring realms, and only the king’s iron fist keeps them from rebelling.<br><br>The Redanian army consists of thirty-five thousand armed men, which number includes a core of four thousand elite knights. Soon after the outbreak of the Third War against Nilfgaard, Redania’s forces were further supplemented with Temerian and Kaedweni regiments, as well as with mercenary troops from Poviss and Kovir. Indeed, one can now accurately speak of a united army of the North led by King Radovid V.<br><br>The Redanian treasury relies on the profitable trade with Novigrad to fill its coffers, with wheat as the chief staple crop and main commodity. Redania has it in abundance, thus the country is oft called the granary of the North, its landscape consisting almost entirely of rolling waves of grain. Yet despite the land's natural bounty, Redania's economy has been in crisis since war with Nilfgaard broke out once more. The tumult and desperation has led in recent days to the cult of the Eternal Fire gaining more and more adherents.
   1061656|00000000||Vesemir always said no witcher had ever died in his bed, so death in combat surely awaited him as well. Death's wait ended on that mournful day when the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen in pursuit of Ciri. Vesemir gave his all to protect his former ward, whom he had always treated like an adopted granddaughter, and died a hero's death at the hands of Imlerith, the Hunt's cruel general.
   1061641|00000000||All witchers have a great deal in common, but with Eskel and Geralt, the similarities are particularly striking. They first met as two boys of the same age swinging wooden swords at Kaer Morhen. They then went through an ordeal together: the first round of selections, the murderous Changes, the Trial of the Grasses, and training on the Gauntlet - the witchers’ daunting obstacle course. They also received hidings together for more than one act of childish delinquency. When they became adults, they walked the Path separately, but still reconvened at Kaer Morhen nearly every winter to wait out the cold, drink to their successes and remember fallen comrades.<br><br>Though Eskel never gained Geralt’s renown, he equaled the White Wolf in experience and carried out his contracts with care and efficiency. Death had almost taken him many times during his hunts, yet in an ironic twist the hideous scar on his face came not from a monster’s claw but from the blade of Deidre Ademeyn, his highly unpredictable Unexpected Child.<br>
   1061627|00000000||It did not take long for King Radovid of Redania to prove himself a hard and ruthless ruler, one fully deserving to be styled "the Stern." His father, King Vizimir, was murdered when Radovid was quite young, and his mother, Hedwig of Malleore, and a Regency Council ruled in his stead.<br><br>Young Radovid soon seized power in his own right, however, and wrought vengeance on those who had treated him with disrespect. He took to forcing all his potential political opponents to swear allegiance – or face death.<br><br>He waged war not only against Nilfgaard, but also against mages, whom he saw as the root of all evil. Radovid also made every effort to gain control over the Free City of Novigrad, whose fleet and treasury could tip the scales of the ongoing conflict in his favor.<br>
   1061629|00000000||Radovid burned with particularly intense hostility (first kindled in his early childhood) for the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. Rumors spoke of a special torture regimen he had prepared just for her. And while the two dozen points they mentioned were surely an exaggeration, they accurately conveyed the general scale of his hatred.<br>
   1061628|00000000||Geralt's meeting with Radovid confirmed the rumors circulating about the king's mental state. The Redanian monarch was a dangerous madman trapped in his own world of disturbing visions. This did not make him one jot less intelligent or cunning, however.<br><br>Despite his mental afflictions, the young king was manipulating his opponents like a highly skilled puppet master.<br>
   1061602|00000000||The wave of religious and racially-motivated killings that swept through Novigrad in the spring of 1272 coincided with Hubert Rejk's term as coroner at the city morgue.<br><br>Because of this he was overworked and additionally had to bear the harassment of his dislikeable superior, Reverend Nathaniel. It is thus no surprise that he came across as unpleasant and sarcastic when Geralt and he first met.<br><br>Furthermore, it was clear there was bad blood between him and Joachim von Gratz, a fact that did little to improve the already rather stiff atmosphere at the morgue. Nevertheless, having learned the reason for Geralt's unexpected visit, Hubert made it clear Geralt and Joachim could count on his help.<br>
   1061611|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue.<br>
   1061609|00000000||It seemed the surgeon was no stranger to violence, for he bore a formidable scar worthy of a veteran of the Battle of Brenna.<br>
   1061608|00000000||We met Joachim von Gratz, chief surgeon at Vilmerius Hospital, in very unfortunate circumstances. My Priscilla had been attacked and he was tending to her wounds.<br><br>I must admit I was so shaken I hardly remember our first meeting, save that he was a cool-headed doctor who seemed to know a great deal about the previous murders and offered his help investigating the matter.<br>
   1061612|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue. When asked why, von Gratz explained that, thirty years earlier, Hubert had denounced him to the authorities for his political activities.<br>
   1061146|00000000||Though the youngest of the three Crones, the Weavess was not one jot less ugly or evil than her older sisters. It was she who wove their magic tapestries of human hair gathered as tribute from the young children of nearby villages during their "cutting" ceremonies. These tapestries were how the worshipers of the Ladies of the Wood made contact with and paid homage to their deities.<br>
   1061150|00000000||During the Crones' sabbath it turned out the sisters truly did feed on human flesh, cooking it up in infernal pots and spicing it with root from the cursed tree growing atop Bald Mountain.<br>
   1061149|00000000||The Crone known as Brewess was the middle of the three demonic sisters in terms of age - but the first in terms of size. Brewess was said to be a master concocter of magical mixtures, and, in the more ghastly legends, was said to know over a dozen different recipes for human soup.<br>
   1061154|00000000||Yet no magic, however old, could save her from Cirilla's wrath.
   1061153|00000000||The Crones of Velen were not just old – they were literally ancient, having been around since the reign of the first human kings and possibly even since the coming of the elves.<br><br>Of the three ghastly sisters, the Whispess was most ancient, or at least so claimed the swamp dwellers' whispered legends. Whispered, for if they spoke too loudly the Crone would hear it – for she demanded tribute in the form of human ears, which she hung from trees and through which, using primeval magic, she heard all that happened in the swamp.<br>
   1061156|00000000||Reverend Nathaniel, supervisor of the city morgue and cleric of the Church of the Eternal Fire, was a man with a vile character - and a stormy past.

   1058711|00000000||In exchange for information about Cirilla, the baron asked Geralt to find his wife, Anna, and their daughter Tamara. Both had disappeared without a trace some time ago, and Phillip was slowly losing hope of ever seeing them again. Under these circumstances, a witcher was a gift from the gods.<br>
   1058710|00000000||His treatment of children and young women, towards whom he demonstrated a wholly sincere, near fatherly-concern, likewise contradicted his bandit-like appearance and terrifying moniker. Ciri had learned this for herself, finding care and shelter under his roof.<br>
   1058709|00000000||During his first encounter with "Baron" Phillip Strenger, Geralt found the man's many contradictions puzzling. This former Temerian soldier was clearly an opportunist who, after his army's resounding defeat, served, dealt and negotiated with the occupying Empire of Nilfgaard. The local peasantry anointed him the "Bloody Baron," a clear indication that he did not handle his vassals with kid gloves. On the other hand, he proved a surprisingly gracious host to an unexpected guest who was also a stranger and a hired monster slayer.<br>
   1058746|00000000||The baron’s daughter, Tamara, had disappeared with her mother some time before Geralt arrived at Crow's Perch. The baron described her as a charming young maid of nineteen summers and the apple of his eye. No wonder, then, that the lord of Crow's Perch was desperate to find her.<br>
   1058745|70710c11||It came as a surprise to many when, a mere three years after the Second War against Nilfgaard - the war which, it was said, “would end all wars” - the empire’s forces once again invaded the North. To the perceptive student of history, however, this development was not at all surprising - Nilfgaard’s economy and political system have for decades relied on expansion and conquest for continued survival.<br><br>Attentive analysis shows that Nilfgaard never abandoned its plan to subjugate the North. Contrary to popular belief, imperial diplomats, and not sorceresses, were behind the death of King Foltest. They also brought about the crisis during the summit of mages and monarchs at Loc Muinne. The current conflict is thus the result of cold calculation and long-term planning. Before the wax had time to dry on the Peace of Cintra, Emhyr var Emreis had already begun to prepare for the next war, which ultimately broke out in the spring of 1270.<br><br>The war's first stage went exactly as the emperor had planned. In a matter of months Lyria, Aedirn and Temeria found themselves in the shadow of the black banner. If not for the early frosts of December 1270 and the daring of King Radovid - who, instead of concentrating his forces on the Pontar, invaded Kaedwen thereby doubling his territory and strength - all the North would surely now be but another province in the vast Empire of Nilfgaard.
   1058749|69bf4792||Kovir and Poviss are without a doubt the richest realms in the North. Few today remember that this was not always the case, yet their poverty was once literally on everyone’s lips, in the form of now-antiquated common sayings. As recently as in the days of Heribert the Quarrelsome, one spoke of a particularly impoverished person as being “poorer than a mouse from Poviss,” called bone broth “Koviri delight” and referred to beggars as “praxedes,” after the bay along the shores of which these kingdoms lie.<br><br>Similarly, few remember that a mere handful of generations ago Kovir and Poviss were still a part of Redania. King Radovid I, known as Radovid the Great, handed dominion over them to his hated brother, Troyden, with one stipulation - that he never leave his newly-acquired demesne and not interfere in matters of state.<br><br>Handing over this rocky scrap of far-northern ground (where, the saying went, the year had two seasons - August and winter) was naturally meant as a cruel joke, a slap in the face for the over-ambitious Troyden.<br><br>Yet time soon proved that Radovid the Great had made a grave error. Before long it was discovered that Kovir's bare rocks hid priceless treasure in the form of enormous deposits of precious metals and rock salt. This discovery in turn led to tremendous growth in productive industry. Mills, forges and workshops sprouted up like mushrooms after a hearty rain.<br><br>Radovid III decided to correct his famous forebear's mistake and take back the northern frontiers of his kingdom. He was convinced the combined armies of Redania and its then-ally Kaedwen would quickly bring this ever more audacious vassal in line. History took a different turn, however, and Kovir won a resounding, crushing victory. Radovid III was forced to sign the First Treaty of Lan Exeter, granting Kovir independence while binding it to eternal neutrality - a promise Troyden’s successors have kept with great diligence.<br><br>Until recently Kovir was ruled by Esterad Thyssen, a king as wise as he was greedy. Yet his untimely demise did not stop his lands from continuing to develop and blossom. Koviri metallurgists proudly compete with the best Mahakam can offer, and many believe the University of Lan Exeter long ago surpassed the famous Oxenfurt Academy as the leading seat of higher learning in the North. And so it has come to pass that, over the course of a few generations, the inhabitants of Kovir and Poviss have turned from paupers into princes, from beggars into bankers.

The kind who live according to the gods' laws, and nature's laws, too. Those disgusted by the machinations of witches, magickers and nonhumans. All that separates us from common folk is that we've the courage to take up arms, to defend our lands from evil, to slice out the gangrene that eats us from within.<br><br>We haven't a leader. We haven't forts or land. Though gods-fearing Radovid supports us with his gold at times, we've not sworn him nor any other ruler any oath.

We will explain how to spot the tell-tale signs of evil - birthmarks in strange and arcane shapes, smooth skin on a matron aged more than thirty springs, and black cats kept in the yard, to name but a few. We will show you how to defend yourself from witchcraft, how to tame and snuff out magic elements with dimeritium. We will instruct you how to squeeze the sinners' darkest secrets out of them with a hot iron, and how to grant them cleansing death with the help of sacred fire.
   1058808|00000000||Graden was one of the witch hunters in King Radovid's service. Unlike a great many of his comrades, he came across as a level-headed fellow, one free of prejudice, at least in his dealings with witchers.<br>
   1058814|00000000||Considering the way spy corps of all stripes tend to function, "Hendrik" was undoubtedly not this man's real name. Nevertheless, that was the only appellation the witcher knew for His Imperial Majesty's nose to the ground in Velen.<br><br>After asking around, Geralt learned a "Hendrik" lived in the village of Heatherton.<br>
   1058799|00000000||Yet it seemed Tamara had finally had enough of the way the baron treated her mother and decided to flee along with her.<br>

   1057893|2469fff2||Modolf, progenitor of Clan Drummond, who was granted mastery over the isle of Undvik, unlike his brothers displayed no extraordinary abilities: he was neither wise nor especially brave, nor did he possess any particular gift which would make him a great individual. He resented Hemdall for not bestowing greater talent upon him. Hemdall, however, insisted he had blessed each of his sons with equal gifts, but not all revealed themselves at once - Modolf would have to wait for the right moment for his gifts to step forward. Yet the hero was impatient and could not wait for this moment. Instead, again and again he sought out trouble of the worst sort, hoping each time his hidden talent would shine. Hemdall grew angry with his son and decided to bury his gift even deeper. Modolf died after a long and unruly life filled with incredible adventures, but a life during which he never discovered his talent. His descendants decided to continue his search elsewhere. They abandoned Undvik and invaded Ard Skellig, eventually taking half of that isle for themselves. They now seek to take the other half, but whether doing so would finally reveal their line's unique gift - no one knows.
   1060505|00000000||The devil Fugas held a position of great prestige and responsibility during the Crones' sabbath - that of goon restricting access to the peak. He in no way resembled Torque, the irritating but harmless "deovel" Geralt and I had encountered many, many years prior.<br><br>In size, Fugas resembled a somewhat overgrown troll, and he likewise displayed a troll's lack of subtlety. There was not a jot of mischievous puck or cunning verbal trickster about this "devil." Instead, he did his job with the commitment and professionalism of a Novigrad bouncer.<br><br>Trying to stop Geralt, though, turned out to be Fugas' dumbest and last idea, ending both his life and his flourishing career in the Crones' employ.
   1060531|00000000||Ciri was able to shed a bit of light on the King of the Wild Hunt's motivations. The threat of annihilation hung over the Aen Elle homeland. Eredin, a warrior and a conqueror by nature, decided to solve this problem in the simplest possible way - by seizing our world. The key to doing so? Ciri's power, which would allow him to open the gates to a full-scale invasion.<br>
   1060532|00000000||According to Avallac'h, it was Eredin who bore responsibility for the death of Auberon Muircetach, the previous ruler of the Aen Elle. Revealing this fact would certainly not earn him friends and popularity amongst the Alder Folk.<br>
   1060539|00000000||The emperor clearly and succinctly laid out what he wanted. His daughter and Geralt's ward, Cirilla, was in great danger, for the Wild Hunt was on her trail. Geralt, a superb tracker linked to Emhyr's daughter by the iron bonds of Destiny, stood a better chance of finding her than anyone else in the world.<br>
   1060538|00000000||Few names in the Continent's history arouse as much terror and respect as that of Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd - the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. Emperor of Nilfgaard, lord of Metinna, Ebbing and Gemmera, sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro, he was ruler of half the civilized world and aspiring conqueror of the other half. He was a personage whose deeds and decisions shaped the fates of whole kingdoms and populations.<br><br>What then could he possibly want of a simple witcher?<br>
   1060525|00000000||The name of the King of the Wild Hunt, the identity of the lord of nightmares, the being behind the frightful mask - this long remained unknown. Over time, however, scraps of information gradually coalesced into a full likeness of our foe - but did nothing to detract from the terror he inspired.<br><br>The Wild Hunt was in truth an elite cavalry brigade from the world of the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk, and was commanded by their ambitious and ruthless king, Eredin Bréacc Glas. He would travel via secret paths through the cold emptiness between his world from ours to capture victims and take them back to his homeland as slaves.<br><br>The current object of his Hunt was Cirilla, whose power he wanted to harness for his own uses. The only obstacle in his path - Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1060472|00000000||As predicted, Ge'els acted out of loyalty to his former king and withdrew support for Eredin once he learned the truth about Auberon's death. This momentous act portended important ramifications for the outcome of the coming battle.
   1060181|00000000||Sadly, there was no communicating with Uma. The gnarled twiglet lived in his own miniature world. Yet Geralt knew Uma was the key to finding Ciri. Even if no pertinent information was forthcoming from the creature's stunted lips, surely further investigation would squeeze some solution out of this riddle.<br>
   1059723|00000000||Upon closer acquaintance, Menge only confirmed Geralt's initial impression of his bestiality. Luckily the witcher's blade ended this madman's life and rid the world of one the more hideous monsters ever to walk its surface.<br>
   1059722|00000000||The paranoid executioner never set foot outside his fortified headquarters without a crowd of armed guards to accompany him. Knowing my life was on the line, my friends decided to pursue a risky plan to infiltrate Menge's offices - their only hope for a face-to-face meeting with the man.<br>
   1059720|00000000||In those days rampant persecution and the smoke of a hundred pyres choked Novigrad's air. This grim climate provided cover in which a great many bloody butchers built comfortable nests for themselves. Drummed-up conspiracies, mass arrests and show trials resulting in group executions were the favorite building blocks.<br><br>Caleb Menge, the fanatically ambitious commander of the Church of the Eternal Fire's Temple Guard, was one such opportunist, his moment of triumph coming when he unmasked his superior, the former Temple Guard commander Chappelle, as a doppler in disguise.<br><br>Geralt first saw Menge lighting Chappelle's pyre in Novigrad's main square and had no doubt that, for this man, the appellation "fanatical whoreson" was too mild by far.<br><br>
   1059803|00000000||Those in the know claimed Voorhis' rank and experience made him a shoo-in to succeed the emperor in the event Emhyr decided to hang up his crown.<br>
   1059801|00000000||Morvran Voorhis -  commander of the Alba Division, an officer of the highest rank and a pure-blooded aristocrat, one who with pride could call himself a Nilfgaardian, a designation reserved only for native-born inhabitants of the empire's capital and its immediate surroundings.<br><br>At the time of their first meeting Geralt had no idea what an important person had been assigned the task of "asking him a few routine questions." Knowing the witcher, however, knowledge of Morvran's rank and status would not have made much of a difference.<br>
   1059809|00000000||Imlerith - a general of the Wild Hunt and a frequent guest in Geralt's nightmares - had been chasing Ciri for quite some time, striving to deliver her to his ruler, Eredin.<br><br>This powerful and brutal warrior had fought in the countless battles and campaigns for conquest waged by the Aen Elle in other worlds. He prized physical confrontation above all else, seeking out direct, bloody skirmishes where opponents pit their strength, agility and training against each other in a contest to the death.<br>
   1059679|00000000||The Free City of Novigrad had known no king's rule for nearly two hundred years. Francis Bedlam surely had this fact in mind when he anointed himself the King of Beggars, a title that mocked the pomposity of crowned heads while simultaneously stealing a bit of said pomp for itself. Bedlam was a pragmatic man, a trait of great use in his profession, which involved managing a network of thieves, beggars, tramps and street urchins that trickled through every part of the city.<br><br>His contacts provided him with the freshest gossip and tastiest morsels of information, and the cut he took of his "subjects'" earnings guaranteed a sizeable income for the maintenance of his "court" in the Putrid Grove.<br>
   1059649|00000000||Cleaver was famed for his hot temper. What boiled his blood hottest of all, however, were folk who thought they could pull one over on him.<br><br>No wonder, then, that the attack by Whoreson's thugs riled him somewhat. The violent tirade he directed at Wiley clearly contained not idle threats but promises he meant to keep, even if doing so meant leaving half a district of the city in ruins.<br>
   1059648|00000000||A joke circulates about the back alleys and seedy taverns of Novigrad. It claims the dwarf Carlo Varese, one of the four leading lights of the local criminal strata, was, in his own way, a fierce proponent of racial coexistence. He applied this principle in a somewhat selective fashion, however.<br><br>Cleaver firmly felt that, as an assimilated dwarven resident of the city of Novigrad, he had every right to run his own business. Anyone who had a problem with the way he ran it or with the nature of his dealings - be they dwarf, human or halfling - revealed themselves a vile racist. And what was the only fitting thing to do with such scum? Why, feed them to a herd of ferociously hungry hogs – right after he sliced off their fingers with his namesake cleaver. Naturally, such tales could very well have been mere rumor and slander – but very few had the courage to test their veracity.<br>
   1059655|00000000||When Geralt got a chance to talk to Ciri about Avallac'h, he learned that the Sage had been her tutor and mentor for some time. They were bound by a common enemy. Avallac'h had been the chief advisor to the previous ruler of the Aen Elle, whose demise had precipitated a conflict between Avallac'h and the successor, Eredin. The Sage had thus made it his mission to protect Ciri from his new king's malicious designs, whatever the cost.<br><br>Ciri made it clear to Geralt that she trusted the Sage. He had saved her life on numerous occasions – including when, feeling the onset of the curse that would transform him into Uma, he resolved to hide her form the Wild Hunt on the Isle of Mists.<br>
   1059654|00000000||Geralt and I had long known that Chappelle, Chancellor of Security for the Church of the Eternal Fire in Novigrad, had died years ago and been replaced by a doppler masquerading under his name. We didn't breathe a word of this to anyone, of course, for the change was decidedly in everyone's best interest. The doppler had proved a reasonable creature deprived of the true Chappelle's cruelty, and under his watch life in the city had much improved.<br><br>Sadly, the chancellor's conciliatory style must have raised suspicions as a wave of terror and persecution began to swell over Novigrad. The doppler was found out, arrested and burned at the stake for the greater glory of the Eternal Fire.
   1059652|00000000||The being trapped within Uma's tortured husk turned out to be Avallac'h – a powerful Sage of the Aen Elle elves. Geralt had made his acquaintance years before. Already during these prior encounters Avallac'h had displayed an intense and, frankly, rather unnerving interest in the Elder Blood and its bearer, Ciri. His exact motives were unclear at the time, and he had made no particular effort to explain them to Geralt.<br><br> Geralt likewise had no idea what bound Ciri and the elf now. There was no doubt Avallac'h had helped her, had saved her numerous times from the Wild Hunt – but why? Alas, the Sage, quivering on a razor's edge between life and death, offered no answers to Geralt's burning questions.<br><br>He did, however, muster enough strength to utter a crucial piece of information – Ciri's location.<br>

   1059023|00000000||When the children in the swamp clearing first told Geralt about Johnny, the witcher had every reason to suppose no such person actually existed. It was difficult to imagine anyone living in such inhospitable surroundings without quickly becoming food for drowners or water hags.<br><br>Geralt thus suspected Johnny was the figment of childish imaginations, an imaginary friend for lonely orphans. Long years of experience, however, told him not to ignore any possible lead, so he decided to search the nearby swampland for any additional signs of Johnny.<br>
   1059043|00000000||Graham was a simple fisherman from an even simpler village, Oreton, yet the role he had played in local events was anything but.

Instead, it stood for danger and terror, for a place where wild animals, driven by some mysterious power, had killed many an inhabitant of Downwarren. Geralt agreed to investigate the problem, and soon discovered the animals were controlled by a spirit entrapped in a tree growing atop the hill. The spirit spoke to him in a woman's voice, and claimed to have once been a druidess who had kept watch over the Velen grove until the Crones murdered her and imprisoned her ghost in the tree. The forces of nature she had once served now protected her from the fiendish sisters' further designs. The unfortunate locals had died as collateral damage, for, the spirit attested, nature's wrath is unrestrainable and distinguishes not between unwary innocents and unwelcome ill-wishers.<br><br>The spirit begged Geralt to lift her curse and free her from her torment. In exchange, she promised to rescue the orphans from the swamp clearing, who would otherwise face a cruel death at the hands of hte Crones.<br>

   1072893|00000000||Some time later it was revealed that Roche had took part in a conspiracy to assassinate Radovid. He had realized that once the war was over this mad king would offer no prospect of a free Temeria, making Roche himself a liability and potential foe.<br>

   1068418|00000000||<i>There is no up-to-date map of Nilfgaard. For it just keeps growing.</i><br>-Amerigo Veltucci, cartographer<br><br>Until about a quarter century ago, only the well educated had even heard of Nilfgaard. Back then the empire, though already expanding, had not yet cast its shadow over the Northern Realms. Today, when its black-clad legions have carried banners bearing the Great Sun across the Yaruga all the way to the southern banks of the Pontar, no man in the North does not know the empire's name - and does not tremble upon hearing it.<br><br>Nilfgaard is currently ruled by Emhyr var Emreis, a great politician and strategist. The country consists of about a half dozen provinces, formed from once-conquered lands, and numerous satellite states such as Ebbing, Salm, Toussaint, Maecht, Metinna or Cintra. The latter, though formally independent, are in fact governed directly by the emperor.<br><br>For such a diverse and quickly expanding state, Nilfgaard is surprisingly stable. In recent memory, no rebellion, uprising or domestic war has upset the famed <i>Pax Nilfgaardiana</i>. This might derive from the fact that Nilfgaardians cherish order above all else, including wars and conquest - and  respect laws and courts to an extent unparalleled anywhere in the North.

The Eternal Fire is… hope itself.</i><br>- Chappelle, Commander, Temple Guard of the Church of the Eternal Fire. <br><br>The cult of the Eternal Fire came into being a few centuries past in the Free City of Novigrad. The undying flame, symbolizing hope, is its chief symbol. As the years passed, the cult gained popularity, eventually becoming the dominant religion in the North.<br><br>Initially tolerant of other faiths, the cult of the Eternal Fire grew increasingly radical with time. As the fire which was supposed to drive off darkness began sprouting beneath pyres, its flame, once the symbol of hope, became a sign of terror and oppression. Anyone can become the Eternal Fire's foe, be he mage, alchemist, elf, dwarf... or witcher.

Preferred to break her neck than wind up in their 'ands. </i><br>--Overheard in the Putrid Grove<br><br>Soon after the North's once-respected mages began to face persecution very similar in kind to the religious, a new profession was born - that of witch hunter. These self-righteous brutes may issue from different backgrounds, professions and social strata, but they have one goal which unites them all - to track down and kill any and all suspected of dabbling in magic. <br><br> Some witch hunters are religious fanatics, others are calculating opportunists who concluded that pursuing mages would be an easy way to get rich and secure an elevated station in the "new, better order" promised by their benefactor, King Radovid of Redania.
   1068529|00000000||<i>What's that? You wish to pay with orens? Have you spent the last six months hiding under a rock? Orens are worth as much as bean husks now!</i><br>--Heinrich Zucker, merchant from Ellander<br><br>The war between Nilfgaard and the Northern Realms has not only caused many borders to shift, but has also turned the entire Continent's economy upside-down. Currencies, in particular, have been greatly affected by the political upheaval.<br><br>The surest coin is the crown minted in Novigrad. Thanks to the free city's vibrant economy, its currency is highly valued and is the only means of payment accepted around the world, by the North's merchants, nobles, townsfolk and simple peasants, as well as by Nilfgaardian quartermasters, dwarven bankers, women plying the world's oldest trade and, last but not least, by witchers.<br><br>The value of the Nilfgaardian floren depends on the state of the empire's economy rather than on the coin's gold content. The initial success of the empire's military campaign greatly boosted the currency's worth, but months later, as the conflict lagged on, it began to take its toll, and the coin's value is now dropping slowly but surely. Still, Nilfgaardian florens can be exchanged for crowns at most banks and shops. <br><br>The Temerian oren, bearing the aquiline profile of the now-deceased King Foltest, is, like Temeria itself, one of the least fortunate victims of the war. The value of the currency of this battered, occupied country holds stable, but at a very low level, reflecting the coin's silver content. Still, my good friend Vimme Vivaldi, Novigrad's foremost banker, advises all to get rid of the Temerian currency at their earliest convenience, just in case.

[Don't you behave like a Nordling!]</i><br>--Nilfgaardian expression<br><br>"Nordling" is an all-encompassing term for the inhabitants of the Northern Realms, used mostly by Nilfgaardians and, more rarely, by the folk of Skellige. It is most often used as an epithet implying laziness, treachery, barbarity and excessive lust. As much as I would like to contend we do not deserve such a damning reputation, I generally strive not to lie.

The Crones of Crookback Bog are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. <br><br>Common folk have given these three sisters the names Weavess, Brewess and Whispess, and call the threesome "The Ladies of the Wood" or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of Velen, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. They wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from water and earth and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses.<br><br>The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the swamps in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.

   1077568|6ad3ffa9||Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made three daughters out of dirt and water.<br><br>A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of Velen. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land - men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, Velen was drowning in blood.<br><br>The daughters saw their land nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night of sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her in the bog. Her blood watered the oak atop Ard Cerbin, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land and so the sisters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the Whispering Hillock, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.

In truth, only a blind man, or a sighted man blinded with drink, could mistake the rank sludge and rotting carrion of a water hag's den for a cozy cottage, and the hideous hag herself for an innocent grandmother. Their wrinkled, wart-covered bodies stand nearly two yards tall, with skin the color of a long-dead cadaver and stinking of muck and fish.

   1080719|760a065d||While Nilfgaard's emperor wields absolute power, harshly crushing the slightest sign of disobedience, opposing forces continue to exist within the empire. By this I do not mean the disgruntled leaders of conquered provinces, but the magnates within the City of a Thousand Towers who are unhappy with the current leadership. This conflict between the emperor and the noble houses of Nilfgaard the capital dates back many years. All the princes of the blood and magnates expected their ruler to wed one of their daughters and sire an heir with one of their own. The emperor, however, had other plans. This proved a slap in the face for all the great families from which he refused to take a bride.<br><br>The Nilfgaardian opposition patiently waits for the emperor to slip up, for some event to occur which will weaken his authority, be it an economic crisis or a defeat in battle. A secret conspiracy lies ready to seize such a moment to incite the disaffected, assassinate the emperor and carry out a coup d'état culminating with one of their own number ascending to the throne.<br><br>For obvious reasons, only a limited few know of this conspiracy, but any shrewd observer of Nilfgaardian politics can read the signs of its workings. So long as men are men and the world is as it is, certain dynamics will forever remain the same, and the discontented will always form subversive societies with their secret signs and hidden agendas.

As long as this unfortunate soul remained alive and near the settlement, the leshen would always be reborn near its lair.<br><br>Yet even with the marked one eliminated, killing the leshen would be no easy task. The monster commanded the obedience of the denizens of the woods - it could thus call on wolves, ravens or even the trees themselves for help. Luckily, it had a weakness as well: it was vulnerable to fire, that born of the Igni Sign in particular.

As beings made of stone, they feel no pain from fire, meaning the Igni Sign is worthless against them, as are weapons meant to cause bleeding or poisoning.

   1082432|1a6be9d8||According to legend, many years ago a young woman would wait here and watch for her husband's return from an overseas raid. Years passed and woman grew old, still waiting for her husband. Yet he never came, and finally, she died. Three days after her funeral, her husband returned, having at last escaped from the pirates who had held him captive all this time. When he learned about his beloved's loyal vigil, he wept bitter tears, then leapt to his death.

   1081909|00000000||The apparition haunting the fields outside Novigrad turned out to be a noonwraith. Some powerful emotion must have bound it to that place - love, hate, anger or perhaps all three at once. Like every wraith of this type, she was surely capable of forming mirror images of herself, which served to mislead opponents and restore her vitality. Luckily, these mirages could be dispelled with a quick slash from a silver blade. Like any noonwraith, she would undoubtedly seek to assume immaterial form while fighting, making her almost impossible to injure - unless she is first caught in a trap laid by the Yrden Sign, or blasted with a special bomb. Once thus forced into materiality, she should be attacked with strong blows or the Igni Sign. Finally, one must always keep in mind two witcher sayings: "The longer you fight a noonwraith, the lower your chances of surviving," and "Fight a noonwraith at midday and you'll be dead before dusk."

The witcher, however, harbored no such delusions. He knew she was an extremely powerful monster - but a monster all the same. This meant she could be killed. To do so, he would need the highest quality of bolts, a solid silver blade - and a steady hand.

Some connected the two, claiming Bran sailed out to fight overseas battles to put off dealing with the ones awaiting him at home.

   1100402|17c47abc||[appears to be part of a journal, though only the last pages have survived]<br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXVIII<br><br>Finally done deciphering those gnomish manuscripts. Used them to draw up crafting diagrams for a pair of swords, one silver, the other steel. Varin has forged already. Took it to the Bastion to test its mettle in his favorite way - by bashing young witchers with it during training exercises. Now I can at last return to the old signal tower and continue tinkering with the construction of the teleportation device. Perhaps I can get it to stabilize.<br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXIX<br><br>The shameful impotence which renders me unable to cast a teleportation spell might just reap great benefits for all mankind. The compound I have been researching shall allow teleportation to become a widespread tool - if I can perfect it. Perhaps once I patent this discovery the Conclave will let me out of this prison… I just hope against hope I will finish my work before the witchers force me to conduct another Trial… <br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXXII<br><br>My third sleepless night in a row. This tower is freezing. The compound is still unable to generate a stable portal. Meanwhile Varin continues torturing me with additional untranslated manuscripts – this time I am to draw up an armor diagram. <br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXXVII<br><br>The armor diagram's finished, but I cannot return to work on the compound. We will soon begin another Trial of the Grasses. I swear on the Power, I cannot stand this much longer. Of all the mages, why did the Conclave have to sentence me to be the resident of Kaer Morhen?<br><br>service date: MMMMCMXLVIII<br><br>Bartel, Diederik, Jaap, Aleid... those are only the latest victims. I can still see their faces, smell the stench of the vomit, the excrement in which they died. An unending nightmare.<br><br>The handful who survived being poisoned by mutagens, alchemical decoctions and brews made from hallucinogenic mushrooms will later be entrusted to psychopathic instructors. Like Varin. For two weeks I kept watch by Koenrad’s bedside, for two weeks I nursed him back to the land of the living, only for Varin to beat him near to death during his first day of training in the Bastion.<br><br>Witchers fight monsters? Witchers are themselves monsters! They have stared too long into the abyss… Since one cannot count on the wrath of the gods, perhaps the wrath of the people should be used instead…
   1100401|203d5550||Hieronymus' journal
   1100404|1979535b||[notes containing thorough breakdowns of hours-long fencing instruction sessions for young witchers, with many annotations in the margins]<br><br>That mage finally proved himself good for something. The steel sword I forged following his instructions is top-notch. Seems he has deciphered the second manuscript as well - need to stop by the watchtower and take it from him.<br><br>That old coot Hieronymus came bothering me again. I don't like the way he looks at my pupils. I don't like his arrogance and need to stick his nose in others' business. Yesterday evening he reproached me in front of the squirts for, as he put it, "excessively burdening bodies exhausted from long-term intoxication." These are witchers, dammit, not some band of snot-nosed scribes-to-be in a rectory school!<br><br>To make matters worse, rather than prepare for the upcoming Trial of the Grasses, he's shut himself up in the old signal tower, works on something all through the night. Gotta check what he's up to in there.

   1109257|6259f0ec||[PL] Dzięki pancerzowi Elgara opracowałem nowe stopy metali i udało mi się zwiększyć przewodnictwo magii drugiego kryształu. To może być przełom w pracach nad teleportem, który przyda się zwiadowcom. Skalibrowałem teleport próbnie na jaskinię u stóp wieży. Muszę tylko naładować kryształ energią słoneczną, więc umieściłem go na zewnętrznej ścianie wieży, od strony rusztowania. Odliczam godziny potrzebne do całkowitego naładowania kryształu. <br>Skończyłem prace nad recepturą, dzięki której będziemy mogli powielać pancerz i w ten sposób uzbroimy całą Szkołę Wilka. Wiedźmin Varin, nasz nauczyciel fechtunku puszy się, że to on znalazł ekwipunek Elgara, ale to przecież ja, rozumując logicznie i tylko w niewielkim stopniu posiłkując się magią, odkryłem komnatę, w której musiał mieszkać Elgar. Komnata była zamaskowana prymitywną iluzją, naprawdę wystarczyło wytężyć wzrok, żeby ją przeniknąć. Znalazłem zapiski, z których wynika, że Elgar dysponował ulepszeniami rynsztunku, i że poukrywał je na całym świecie, do użytku innych wiedźminów ze Szkoły Wilka.  Skończyłem sporządzanie mapy, na której zaznaczyłem wszystkie ulepszenia. Mapę i dalsze prace nad ulepszeniami przekazałem Chirdowi w Starej Strażnicy. Gdy skończy przygotowywać recepturę miecza srebrnego, ma wyruszyć, żeby zebrać wszystkie ulepszenia. Wiem, że receptura stalowego miecza jest już gotowa i Varin ma sporządzić kilka mieczy dla młodych wiedźminów. Być może nowe miecze choć trochę wyrównają szanse tych chłopców w regularnych masakrach, jakie Varin im urządza, nazywając to szkoleniem.<br> <br> Bogowie, zauważyłem właśnie ogień na horyzoncie. To chyba płonie Stara Strażnica! Słyszę tumult wokół wieży. Ścieżka w dół jest odcięta! Co się dzieje?!

   1108371|e5632e7b||[PL] Piszę w wielkim pośpiechu. Zabarykadowałem się w pracowni, bo Warownię zaatakował tłum chłopów uzbrojonych chyba we wszystko, czym da się wywijać. Byłem zajęty pracą nad recepturą genialnego srebrnego miecza wiedźmińskiego i nie zauważyłem, że nadciąga tłuszcza.  Mam nadzieję, że wiedźmin Varin przyjdzie po mnie i wyciągnie mnie stąd. <br>Varin ma ze sobą stalowy miecz, drugi z kompletu, na szczęście przekazałem mu recepturę parę dni temu. Jego uczniowie z Bastionu są razem z nim. Jestem pewny, że dadzą sobie radę z bandą kmieci z kosami na sztorc. Jednak boję się o mojego mistrza, od wielu dni nie wychodził z wieży, pracuje w natchnieniu nad schematem zbroi, mógł w ogóle nie zauważyć tego, co tu się dzieje.<br>Dlaczego nie skończyłem pracy wcześniej i zgodnie z poleceniem mojego mistrza nie pojechałem badać śladów Elgara, legendarnego wiedźmina Wilka? Gdybym to zrobił choćby wczoraj, byłbym już w bezpiecznej odległości od Kaer Morhen. Hieronymus dał mi mapę, na której zaznaczył miejsca, gdzie Elgar ukrył ulepszenia wiedźmińskiego rynsztunku.

   1108368|c23f81d8||[PL] Zaatakowała rozwścieczona tłuszcza. Tłum wdarł się do wieży. Odcięli mi drogę po drugi kryształ. Musiałem się ratować. Zdążyłem jeszcze chwycić schematy uzbrojenia Szkoły Wilka. Może dzięki nim będę wystarczająco cenny dla Varina, żeby zechciał mnie obronić, gdyby przyszło mi walczyć z chłopami. Skoczyłem. Portal nie zadziałał. Jak podejrzewałem, z jednym kryształem szansa była marna, ale i tak większa niż w przypadku walki z setką żądnych krwi chłopów. Chyba mam złamany kręgosłup i pękniętą wątrobę lub śledzionę. Nie mogę się ruszać.
   1108358|9e0d83d3||[PL] Elgar ukrył ulepszenia do rynsztunku Szkoły Wilka, chcąc żeby posłużyły temu wiedźminowi z Kaer Morhen, który będzie ich potrzebował. Ze względów bezpieczeństwa postanowił użyć kryjówek w trzech różnych miejscach. Jedne z nich są w zatopionej pieczarze pod kasztelem, który wznosi się na wyspie w centralnym Velen. Inne - w jaskiniach na północ od Oxenfurtu, a kolejne w elfich ruinach na południu Velen.
   1108363|f7ebecc2||[PL] Elgar schował ulepszenia wyposażenia z wiedźmińskiej Szkoły Wilka w różnych stronach świata, żeby mogli z nich korzystać wiedźmini na szlaku. Niektóre z nich zostawił w elfickich ruinach i w zatopionym wraku statku na południu Velen. Inne - w specjalnej kryjówce daleko na południe od Oxenfurtu.
   1108362|d4a897b3||[PL] Elgar rozmieścił ulepszenia do wieźmińskiego ekwipunku według prawideł Szkoły Wilka w trzech różnych jaskiniach w południowej części Kaer Morhen. Chciał, aby posłużyły wiedźminowi, który zrobi z nich odpowiedni użytek.
   1108361|f6371423||[PL] Dalsze ulepszenia do wyposażenia wiedźmina ze Szkoły Wilka Elgar rozlokował w różnych rejonach na Wyspach Skellige. Pozostawił je częściowo w drewnianym forcie na południu Ard Skellig, częściowo zaś w ruinach na zachodzie wyspy Hindersfjall. Jeszcze jedna część ukryta jest w kurhanach na zachodzie Ard Skellig.
   1108360|9fc25c72||[PL] Ulepszenia do ekwipunku wiedźmina ze Szkoły Wilka zostały ukryte przez Elgara wokół Kaer Morhen. Część z nich w najgłębszej jaskinii, jaką odkrył w północnej części doliny Kaer Morhen. Część - w nieużywanej, zrujnowanej strażnicy, w tejże północnej części doliny. Zaś pozostałe umieścił wśród skał przy brzegu jeziora, również w dolinie Kaer Morhen.

   1108366|cdf610b9||[PL] Znalazłem dzisiaj coś, co ma szanse uratować Szkołę Wilka przed degrengoladą i rozsypką, w jaką wpędzają nas te żałosne chłystki, które przychodzi mi szkolić. Odkryłem kompletny pancerz i ekwipunek Elgara, wiedźmina, który zapoczątkował Szkołę Wilka. Cały sprzęt w doskonałym stanie przeleżał dziesiątki lat w zamurowanej kawernie w zbrojowni. Podmyte mury skruszały i Hieronymus stękał, że w dziurze lęgną się szczury wielkości kotów. Mówiłem, żeby się pofatygował do zbrojowni i sam załatwił sprawę piorunem kulistym, czy tam inną magiczną bombą, w końcu od czego jest czarownikiem? Ale on potrafi tylko bełkotać o etyce i moralności.<br>Dzięki temu to ja znalzłem pancerz i ekwipunek Elgara, legendarnego Wilka, w którego istnienie niejeden z nas już zwątpił! Jestem pewien, że możemy zrobić z tego uzbrojenia użytek.

   1108364|098ed2f4||[PL] Część ulepszeń do wyposażenia Szkoły Wilka ukryta jest na wyspach Skellige. Elgar pozostawił je w centralnej części Ard Skellig, oraz w ruinach dwóch strażnic: na Undvik i Spikeroog. Chciał, żeby dobrze posłużyły wiedźminowi, który ich może potrzebować i będzie na tyle sprytny, żeby je odnaleźć.

You were to rid the city of the other members of the so-called "Big Four," yet not only do they still live, but they also now know of your role in their attempted assassination. That was not our arrangement.<br><br>For the time being, hide in the place which the messenger delivering this missive will indicate to you and stay out of sight.

It would take seas of ink to describe the city accurately, so suffice it to say it is the seat of the Church of the Eternal Fire, a bustling port city and a haven for artists… and all sorts of other shady characters.<br><br>Yet Novigrad at this time was not the city Geralt knew from his earlier travels. War raged throughout the known world, and rich cities often prove tempting morsels to armies on the march. It was clear at this time that this particular morsel had both Radovid and Emhyr greedily licking their chops. Within the city, the Temple Guard acted with impunity under the command of a cankerous snot named Caleb Menge and with the support of that terror-spreading band of zealots, the witch hunters. Meanwhile, the kingpins of the city's underworld still held much of it in their sleazy grasp.<br><br>Finding Ciri here would be like searching for a needle in a burning haystack - Geralt would clearly need some assistance. Luckily, an old acquaintance of his now lived in Novigrad. Her name was Triss Merigold.<br>
    441253|e3a31e17||What worries me most, brothers and sisters, is our moral decay. Townsmen disdain their marital beds, instead seeking out loose women to fulfill their manly desires. Their wives return the favor and look for any opportunity to cuckold them. Their children are either born bastards or dispatched with the help of witches. More folk flock to the so-called pleasure houses than to our temple, despite the fact that within their walls one is more likely to find rot than any pleasure. Men sleep with men, women with women, humans with nonhumans.<br><br>"What next?" I ask you. What will our depravity bring? Will man marry goat? Will premarital intercourse become a commonplace affair? No, brothers and sisters! The Eternal Fire must burn away these sins! The Fire - and only the Fire - can cleanse us!

    469954|06b28b45||Among the many faiths of the Nordlings, the most widespread is the cult of Melitele, a goddess who takes three forms: young girl, mature woman and old crone. Melitele is a Mother Goddess who cares for her children. Primarily women pray to her, though men in need might also utter supplications. The religion is a vestige of the old matriarchy and testifies to the weakness of the Nordlings - people who worship female deities are soft-hearted and incapable of preparing their sons for war.<br><br>In recent years, the cult of Melitele has found a rival in the cult of the Eternal Fire, which came out of Novigrad. Clerics of the Eternal Fire demonstrate fanaticism and almost complete devotion. The religion is hostile toward any form of otherness, including nonhumans. The Order of the Flaming Rose is the cult's military arm.<br><br><br><br>The treatise also examines other faiths, including the cult of the Lionhead Spider.
    519864|46072d3c||Most historians ascribe the trial, sentencing and execution of Joachim de Wett to the violent, cruel and tyrannical nature of Emperor Emhyr, although many authors with a predilection for sensationalizing propose loaded hypotheses about vengeance and the settling of thoroughly private scores. It is high time to tell the truth – a truth that is and has long been more than clear to every scholar.<br><br>Duke de Wett led the Verden Group. To describe the manner in which he did so as “incompetent” would be far too kind. Facing a force half as strong as his own, he delayed the northern offensive, turning all his attention to the fight against the guerillas of Verden.<br><br>The Verden Group brought unheard of cruelties to bear against the civilian population. The result proved as predictable as it was inevitable - whereas in winter the insurgents numbered a mere half thousand, by spring nearly the entire country had taken up arms against us. King Ervyll, a loyal liege subject to the Empire, was killed, and his son, Crown Prince Kistrin, who sympathized with the Nordlings, was made king.<br><br>With Skellige raiders biting at his flanks, a Nordling offensive coming from Cidaris before him, and a rebellion at his rear, de Wett became bogged down in a chaotic struggle and suffered one defeat after another. This in turn delayed Army Group Center's offensive – instead of pinning down the Nordlings’ flanks as it was to, the Verden Group tied down Menno Coehoorn. The Nordlings took advantage of the situation immediately. They mounted a counter-offensive, breaking through the ring of forces encircling Mayena and Maribor, and thwarting any chance for the quick recapture of these important fortresses. De Wett’s incompetence ineptitude and stupidity also affected morale. The myth of an invincible Nilfgaard was shattered. New recruits began to pour into the armies of the North by the hundreds…

Outlook positive.<br><br>Rumors has abound that Radovid has found a way to get his hands on Novigrad. The key to Novigrad is the Eternal Fire - control the hierarch, control the city. A plan is in the works. Next message - the stash at Crippled Kate's.
    591641|00000000||<i>Wolves aren't as bad as they're made out to be. Werewolves, though – they're every bit as bad and worse.</i><br>– Elsa Vilge, archer <br><br>Werewolves are creatures with both men and wolves inside them. When in beastly form, they take the worst traits from each: the wolf's drive to kill and hunger for raw flesh and the man's cruel and calculating intelligence. A werewolf's condition comes about through a curse, and the transformations happen outside his conscious control. When he reverts to human form, he has no memory of his deeds – otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life.<br>
   1002196|00000000||And Johnny, as always, proved very helpful indeed. He revealed to Geralt that the Crones worked their magic in the cellar of the hut with the tapestry. When Geralt and Graden descended down into it, they found a collection of dolls with various items attached to them. They tried to lift the curse by removing the doll that represented Anna, but their efforts ended in catastrophe - Anna's curse was lifted, but she died soon afterwards, for the Crones had constructed it to leave death as its parting gift. Following her mother's death, Tamara returned to Oxenfurt, her spirits crushed. The baron, in no less foul a mood, went back to Crow's Perch. Geralt watched him walk away, wondering if he would ever see the man again.<br>

   1046083|00000000||It turned out Sigi Reuven was none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence and a man well-known to Geralt from past adventures. In an atypical bout of ignorance, Dijkstra had no inkling I was involved in the theft of his gold. He treated Geralt's appearance as a fortunate coincidence and offered him a handsome sum in return for help finding his stolen wealth - and the thief who had stolen it. Geralt and Dijkstra thus both wanted to find the exact some person - yours truly - albeit for entirely different reasons. Seizing this bit of good fortune, Geralt accepted the offer and hoped against hope Dijkstra wouldn't catch on to his double dealing.<br>

Used them to draw up crafting diagrams for a pair of swords, one silver, the other steel. Varin has forged already. Took it to the Bastion to test its mettle in his favorite way - by bashing young witchers with it during training exercises. Now I can at last return to the old signal tower and continue tinkering with the construction of the teleportation device. Perhaps I can get it to stabilize.<br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXIX<br><br>The shameful impotence which renders me unable to cast a teleportation spell might just reap great benefits for all mankind. The compound I have been researching shall allow teleportation to become a widespread tool - if I can perfect it. Perhaps once I patent this discovery the Conclave will let me out of this prison… I just hope against hope I will finish my work before the witchers force me to conduct another Trial… <br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXXII<br><br>My third sleepless night in a row. This tower is freezing. The compound is still unable to generate a stable portal. Meanwhile Varin continues torturing me with additional untranslated manuscripts – this time I am to draw up an armor diagram. <br><br>days in service: MMMMCMXXVII<br><br>The armor diagram's finished, but I cannot return to work on the compound. We will soon begin another Trial of the Grasses. I swear on the Power, I cannot stand this much longer. Of all the mages, why did the Conclave have to sentence me to be the resident of Kaer Morhen?<br><br>service date: MMMMCMXLVIII<br><br>Bartel, Diederik, Jaap, Aleid... those are only the latest victims. I can still see their faces, smell the stench of the vomit, the excrement in which they died. An unending nightmare.<br><br>The handful who survived being poisoned by mutagens, alchemical decoctions and brews made from hallucinogenic mushrooms will later be entrusted to psychopathic instructors. Like Varin. For two weeks I kept watch by Koenrad’s bedside, for two weeks I nursed him back to the land of the living, only for Varin to beat him near to death during his first day of training in the Bastion.<br><br>Witchers fight monsters? Witchers are themselves monsters! They have stared too long into the abyss… Since one cannot count on the wrath of the gods, perhaps the wrath of the people should be used instead…
   1100404|1979535b||[notes containing thorough breakdowns of hours-long fencing instruction sessions for young witchers, with many annotations in the margins]<br><br>That mage finally proved himself good for something. The steel sword I forged following his instructions is top-notch. Seems he has deciphered the second manuscript as well - need to stop by the watchtower and take it from him.<br><br>That old coot Hieronymus came bothering me again. I don't like the way he looks at my pupils. I don't like his arrogance and need to stick his nose in others' business. Yesterday evening he reproached me in front of the squirts for, as he put it, "excessively burdening bodies exhausted from long-term intoxication." These are witchers, dammit, not some band of snot-nosed scribes-to-be in a rectory school!<br><br>To make matters worse, rather than prepare for the upcoming Trial of the Grasses, he's shut himself up in the old signal tower, works on something all through the night. Gotta check what he's up to in there.

   1109257|6259f0ec||[PL] Dzięki pancerzowi Elgara opracowałem nowe stopy metali i udało mi się zwiększyć przewodnictwo magii drugiego kryształu. To może być przełom w pracach nad teleportem, który przyda się zwiadowcom. Skalibrowałem teleport próbnie na jaskinię u stóp wieży. Muszę tylko naładować kryształ energią słoneczną, więc umieściłem go na zewnętrznej ścianie wieży, od strony rusztowania. Odliczam godziny potrzebne do całkowitego naładowania kryształu. <br>Skończyłem prace nad recepturą, dzięki której będziemy mogli powielać pancerz i w ten sposób uzbroimy całą Szkołę Wilka. Wiedźmin Varin, nasz nauczyciel fechtunku puszy się, że to on znalazł ekwipunek Elgara, ale to przecież ja, rozumując logicznie i tylko w niewielkim stopniu posiłkując się magią, odkryłem komnatę, w której musiał mieszkać Elgar. Komnata była zamaskowana prymitywną iluzją, naprawdę wystarczyło wytężyć wzrok, żeby ją przeniknąć. Znalazłem zapiski, z których wynika, że Elgar dysponował ulepszeniami rynsztunku, i że poukrywał je na całym świecie, do użytku innych wiedźminów ze Szkoły Wilka.  Skończyłem sporządzanie mapy, na której zaznaczyłem wszystkie ulepszenia. Mapę i dalsze prace nad ulepszeniami przekazałem Chirdowi w Starej Strażnicy. Gdy skończy przygotowywać recepturę miecza srebrnego, ma wyruszyć, żeby zebrać wszystkie ulepszenia. Wiem, że receptura stalowego miecza jest już gotowa i Varin ma sporządzić kilka mieczy dla młodych wiedźminów. Być może nowe miecze choć trochę wyrównają szanse tych chłopców w regularnych masakrach, jakie Varin im urządza, nazywając to szkoleniem.<br> <br> Bogowie, zauważyłem właśnie ogień na horyzoncie. To chyba płonie Stara Strażnica! Słyszę tumult wokół wieży. Ścieżka w dół jest odcięta! Co się dzieje?!

Ze względów bezpieczeństwa postanowił użyć kryjówek w trzech różnych miejscach. Jedne z nich są w zatopionej pieczarze pod kasztelem, który wznosi się na wyspie w centralnym Velen. Inne - w jaskiniach na północ od Oxenfurtu, a kolejne w elfich ruinach na południu Velen.

Zaś pozostałe umieścił wśród skał przy brzegu jeziora, również w dolinie Kaer Morhen.

Zdążyłem jeszcze chwycić schematy uzbrojenia Szkoły Wilka. Może dzięki nim będę wystarczająco cenny dla Varina, żeby zechciał mnie obronić, gdyby przyszło mi walczyć z chłopami. Skoczyłem. Portal nie zadziałał. Jak podejrzewałem, z jednym kryształem szansa była marna, ale i tak większa niż w przypadku walki z setką żądnych krwi chłopów. Chyba mam złamany kręgosłup i pękniętą wątrobę lub śledzionę. Nie mogę się ruszać.

Odkryłem kompletny pancerz i ekwipunek Elgara, wiedźmina, który zapoczątkował Szkołę Wilka. Cały sprzęt w doskonałym stanie przeleżał dziesiątki lat w zamurowanej kawernie w zbrojowni. Podmyte mury skruszały i Hieronymus stękał, że w dziurze lęgną się szczury wielkości kotów. Mówiłem, żeby się pofatygował do zbrojowni i sam załatwił sprawę piorunem kulistym, czy tam inną magiczną bombą, w końcu od czego jest czarownikiem? Ale on potrafi tylko bełkotać o etyce i moralności.<br>Dzięki temu to ja znalzłem pancerz i ekwipunek Elgara, legendarnego Wilka, w którego istnienie niejeden z nas już zwątpił! Jestem pewien, że możemy zrobić z tego uzbrojenia użytek.

   1108371|e5632e7b||[PL] Piszę w wielkim pośpiechu. Zabarykadowałem się w pracowni, bo Warownię zaatakował tłum chłopów uzbrojonych chyba we wszystko, czym da się wywijać. Byłem zajęty pracą nad recepturą genialnego srebrnego miecza wiedźmińskiego i nie zauważyłem, że nadciąga tłuszcza.  Mam nadzieję, że wiedźmin Varin przyjdzie po mnie i wyciągnie mnie stąd. <br>Varin ma ze sobą stalowy miecz, drugi z kompletu, na szczęście przekazałem mu recepturę parę dni temu. Jego uczniowie z Bastionu są razem z nim. Jestem pewny, że dadzą sobie radę z bandą kmieci z kosami na sztorc. Jednak boję się o mojego mistrza, od wielu dni nie wychodził z wieży, pracuje w natchnieniu nad schematem zbroi, mógł w ogóle nie zauważyć tego, co tu się dzieje.<br>Dlaczego nie skończyłem pracy wcześniej i zgodnie z poleceniem mojego mistrza nie pojechałem badać śladów Elgara, legendarnego wiedźmina Wilka? Gdybym to zrobił choćby wczoraj, byłbym już w bezpiecznej odległości od Kaer Morhen. Hieronymus dał mi mapę, na której zaznaczył miejsca, gdzie Elgar ukrył ulepszenia wiedźmińskiego rynsztunku.
